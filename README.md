AppLocker Policy Generator helps you create and manage security policies that control which programs can run on Windows. 
Instead of manually writing complex policy files, this tool provides a simple interface where you can add applications, set rules for what's allowed or blocked, and organize everything into clear layers. 
You can start with pre-built templates for different types of computers (workstations, servers, kiosks), bulk import entire folders of files at once, validate your policies to catch common mistakes, and export everything ready to deploy. 
The tool runs entirely in your web browser—no installation needed—and helps security teams build comprehensive application control policies without getting lost in technical details.


first version, so much to improve upon....
